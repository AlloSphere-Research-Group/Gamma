Generator/Oscillator/LFO

An LFO is a subclass of a unsigned 32 bit phase accumulator.
 It's output is determined by a series of named generation
 methods which map the internal integer phase to a floating
 point value according to various strategies. This allows 
 the user to quickly and efficiently switch different LFOs
 generator methods at run-time using the same object instance.
